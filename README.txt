Preamble:

Although jQuery can be integrated into a full dynamic site, it can also be used before much knowledge of server side scripting has been covered.

The solutions provided illustrate the jQuery componenets without getting into the larger integration with a php code base. If you are integrating the solutions into your own solutions from previous chapters you may want to start from your solution, rather than start with the provided html files.
