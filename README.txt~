Although jQuery can be integrated into a full dynamic site, it can also be used before much knowledge of server side scripting has been covered.

The solutins provided are inteneded to illustrate the jQuery componenets without getting into the larger integration with a php code base. If you are integrating the solutions into a  larger framework, the php files will need to be edited to refer to your data model.
